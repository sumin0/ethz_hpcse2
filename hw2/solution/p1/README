HOW TO RUN
----------
To run the code on Euler remove all previously loaded nodules (purge) and load the following modules:

module purge; 
module load new; 
module load gcc; 
module load open_mpi/3.0.0; 
module load hdf5

You can request 8 cores and an interative shell to work with:
bsub -n 8 -W  04:00 -Is bash

Then compile and run by typing
make run


WHAT TO MODIFY
--------------
You only need to change the code in wave.cpp
When the code runs, it prints a checksum. This number should be the same for the solution you provide.


CODE OUTPUT 
-----------
You are not asked to visualize any results in this question, but we thought I'd be nice if you can see what you are actually solving.
Other outputs are .h5 files which can be used to visualize the solution. Each .h5 file corresponds to an .xmf file.
You can use Paraview to open the .xmf files and visualize the results.
Alternatively, you may comment out the line
#define USE_HDF5
with '//' in wave.h. In this case, the code will output simple .txt files with the solution, saved as
x y z u
...
